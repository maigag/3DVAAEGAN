# 3DVAAEGAN

We introduce 3DVAAEGAN, a 3D fully-convolutional variational adversarial auto encoder generative adversarial network 
that takes an incomplete 3D scan of a scene as input and performs scene and semantic completion. 
The main contribution of our model is to perform reconstruction at a high resolution, in a realistic manner, and on 
arbitrary scene sizes, combining the power of GANs and VAEs 
and helping the latter modeling the latent space with the support of an adversarial loss.
